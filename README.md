1. Open Firefox and go to `about:config`
2. Search for:  
toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets
3. Set it to `true`.

### 2. Locate Your Firefox Profile Folder
1. Go to `about:support`
2. Under **"Profile Folder"**, click **"Open Folder"** (or **"Show in Finder"** on macOS)

### 3. Set Up the Chrome Folder
1. Inside your profile folder, create a new folder named `chrome` (if it doesn't already exist)
2. Place the `userChrome.css` file into this `chrome` folder

Your Firefox Profile/
└── chrome/
└── userChrome.css


### 4. Restart Firefox
Close and reopen Firefox to apply your new custom theme.

### 5. Apply the Recommended Firefox Theme (Optional but Recommended)
To make the UI **look awesome**, install this matching theme from Firefox Add-ons:
